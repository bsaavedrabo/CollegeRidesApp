# Agora, Berea College Rides App
iOS and Android app that allows Berea College students to earn $ and/or find rides faster

## Problem statement: 
Berea College students struggle to get around without owning a car and public transportation (FootHills) has limited hours. Due to personal experiences as international students, we were inspired to create a solution that would not only support people to find rides faster (rather than begging people on the Facebook group) but also open a gig for people who own cars on campus.
